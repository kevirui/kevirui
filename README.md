I'am a passionate Information Systems Engineering student and aspiring full-stack developer. With a strong interest in web development and artificial intelligence, I am constantly seeking to enhance my skills and stay updated with the latest technologies. Currently, I'm focused on mastering the MERN stack and Python for both back-end, front-end development and data science applications.

I love to learn and build something new, productive, innovative and creative.

In my spare time, I also enjoy learning new languages, staying active, and challenging myself with new personal projects. I'm always open to collaboration and excited about opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow professionally.
